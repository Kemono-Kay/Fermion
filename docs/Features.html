<h1>(Planned) Feature List</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>Ease of use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Updates are detected automatically.</li>
      <li>Chat logs are saved automatically and can be imported from F-Chat.</li>
      <li>When the app starts, everything is resumed the way it was when the app closed.</li>

      <li>Characters that don't exist are marked differently from characters that have a default avatar (If I can get that to work)</li>
      <li>The strength of your connection is estimated, so you can see if you're about to disconnect.</li>
      <li>Information is cached, so you don't need a connection to use most features.</li>
      <li>Ads can be posted to multiple channels at once (so no more copying and pasting between channels).</li>
      <li>Ads can be queued up and posted multiple times, with a customizable delay.</li>

      <li>The client keeps track of unread in addition to unanswered replies.</li>
      <li>Channels can be joined as if they are a single channel so you can view related channels at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When searching through channels and/or users, extensive filtering and sorting capabilities are present.</li>

      <li>Channels can be split into separate ads and chat channels for organisation purposes.</li>
      <li>Users can be grouped into as many different groups as you want, and can be hidden, highlighted, recoloured, given different icons, etc. in any way you wish. Default user groups for gender and status are also available for this purpose.</li>
      <li>Notifications can be customised any way you wish, including whether to play sound, display desktop notifications and more.</li>

      <li>You can optionally hide your typing status from users.</li>
